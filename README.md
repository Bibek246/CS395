Analysis of Algorithm

In this couse I learned about ABET :
1) Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other
relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
(6) Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce
computing-based solutions.

Substantial coverage of algorithms and complexity
o The study of computing-based systems at varying levels of abstraction.
ABET topics:
1. Substantial coverage of algorithms and complexity
2. The study of computing-based systems at varying levels of abstraction.
